We have successfully designed a file sharing protocol with filesystem-like capabilities. The protocol fulfils
some of its stated goals: it is easy to implement, communicates securely, and allows for operation
interleaving.  It also has strong provisions for extensibility and cross-platform interoperability.  Further
research is required to determine if the protocol exhibits the expected characteristics on unreliable and
high-latency networks.

We have proven that the design is viable by implementing and testing a server and a virtual filesystem backed
by the proposed protocol. The prototype allowed us to show that the protocol has all the features needed to
reliably function as a filesystem. This make it possible to integrate it into an operating system.

In our future work, we would like to focus on improving performance of the implementations, to the point where
they are usable for practical purposes, and then observe how they perform in real-world scenarios. We have
briefly outlined some possible performance improvements in Chapter~4.

There is also room for improvement in the protocol specification. Chapter~3 mentions a number of
possible future advancements, including reordering of replies, notifications from the server, and a locking
extension.
